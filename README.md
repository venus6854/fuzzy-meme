# Warp contracts - WASM templates

This repo contains Warp WASM contracts templates in:

- [AssemblyScript](assemblyscript/README.md)
- [Rust](rust/pst/README.md)
- [Go](go/README.md)

It allows to quickly jump into contract development - each template contains an example PST contract,
deployment scripts (on localhost, testnet and mainnet), build scripts and example tests - all backed-up by the [Warp SDK](https://github.com/warp-contracts/warp).

Legend:

- `R&D` - we need to make some research and development before implementing the feature
- `Soon` - the technology is already there, we just need to find some time to add the missing features :-)
- `(1)` - access current transaction data (id, owner, etc.)
- `(2)` - access current block data (indep_hash, height, timestamp)
- `(3)` - access current contract data (id, owner)
